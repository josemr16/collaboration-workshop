        <h1><strong>We are World Animal Protection. We were known as WSPA</strong></h1>
        <h2>As WSPA (World Society for the Protection of Animals) we’ve moved the world 
            to protect animals for the last 30 years. Our name may have changed, but our 
            work – and our determination to protect animals – remains the same.</h2>
        <h3>Introducing World Animal Protection</h3>
        <h4>We protect the world’s animals. We always have done, and we always will. 
            But every day, in every country, millions of animals are suffering. And the 
            more people who know about us, the more animals we can reach. That’s why we 
            need our name to evolve. That’s why we need a name that is clearer, more distinct 
            and more memorable. That’s why we are now World Animal Protection.</h4>
        <h2>Our name has changed, but our work – and our determination to protect animals 
            – remains the same.</h2>
        <h3>The benefits of changing our name</h3>
        <h2>Our new name demonstrates who we are and what we stand for, clearly and simply. 
            It will help more people understand what we do and what we want to achieve. And 
            it will encourage more people to support us in transforming animals’ lives.</h2>
